[]2 wall passes, one for bottom and right sides being on a higher layer, left and top sides being on a lower layer...gives a true illusion of passing through the wall
[*]If the ghost is hidden and uses skills, he will appear without the fear bonus
[*]Bug in A* implementation that when the target position is inside of a block, it doesn't return a path
[]AI can walk through walls sometimes
[]Once we change to pathing but get around the walls, we should ray cast the target to see if we can go back to tracking the lost target
[]Enemy AI needs to stop when close and start fighting
[]Seems as once a single enemy can see the ghost, they all can
[]can damage through walls
[]New mob spawn gets hit with damage
[*]Mobs only perform their skills once, after that they cannot find ghosts in range
[]If we don't get a path, end the behaviour
[]If a ghost goes into a wall visible, the mobs get stuck
[]AI manager crashes in weird scenarios
[]AI follows the player into a wall if the player clicks in (try around the border)
[*]Tutorial Scenario reset
[*]Screen reset on push
[*]Tutorial can attack the mob before the correct stage
[*]if you assign a ghost to move, but de-select him, he stops moving until you select him again
